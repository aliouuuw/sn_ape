# Sama Naffa Pre-Marketing Web Platform - Sprint and Task Breakdown

**Version 1.0 - Based on specs.md v3.0**

This document breaks down the Sama Naffa pre-marketing web platform project into agile sprints and actionable tasks. The structure follows the development phases outlined in the specs (Section 7.1), adapted for a frontend-first approach: initial sprints focus on UI mockups and static prototypes without backend integration (no auth, business logic, or database operations). Backend will be added in later sprints after UI approval. Each phase maps to a sprint of approximately 2 weeks. Tasks are derived from feature specifications (Section 4), technical requirements (Section 5, frontend only initially), UX guidelines (Section 6), and other relevant sections.

Sprints focus on iterative delivery, with clear deliverables, dependencies, and success criteria. Future enhancements (Section 7.2) are outlined in later sprints. Each sprint includes:
- **Objectives**: High-level goals.
- **Tasks**: Granular, assignable work items.
- **Dependencies**: Prerequisites from prior sprints or external factors.
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes aligned with KPIs (Section 8).
- **Estimated Effort**: Rough story points (1-8 scale) for planning.

Total estimated timeline: 7 weeks for MVP, plus post-MVP sprints.

- **Team Allocation**: Assume 4-6 developers; assign tasks by frontend/backend/UX roles.
- **Tools**: Jira/Trello for tracking, Git for version control.
- **Milestones**: End of Sprint 4 = MVP launch; monitor KPIs weekly.
- **Assumptions**: Budget for AWS/hosting; access to SMS/OTP providers.

This breakdown ensures phased delivery while aligning with strategic goals (Section 1.3) and mitigating risks (Section 9).
